# flipr
A flashcard web application that allows you to create and review decks of flashcards. 

flipr has a custom method that allows you to grade how well they know the material when reviewing the cards, and then uses this information to determine when to show you the card again.

It also lets you delay seeing the reverse of the cards your reviewing until later, when you can see if you were correct, and grade the cards in bulk. This method has been shown to improve recall across several studies. 

This is an ongoing project, and new features and designs are still to come!
