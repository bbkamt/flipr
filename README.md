# h1 flipr
flipr is a web app that allows users to create flashcards, organise them 
in decks, and has a custom method for reviewing cards. 

Users grade how well they know each card, and based on that score, flipr
will calculate when you need to be shown the card again in order 
to give you the best chance of remembering the material. 

flipr also gives you the option of delaying when you see the reverse of the flashcards, so you can review the answers in bulk at the end of your study session and update all their scores in one go. This method has been shown to improve recall in several studies. 

## Technologies 
Flipr is being developed using:
